# Running HatsuneeBot on Termux and Replit

## Termux Instructions

1. Open Termux on your Android device.

2. Update and upgrade Termux packages:
   ```
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   ```

3. Install Node.js and npm:
   ```
   pkg install nodejs
   ```

4. Create a directory for your project:
   ```
   mkdir HatsuneeBot
   cd HatsuneeBot
   ```

5. Create a new file named `hatsuneeAuth.js`:
   ```
   nano hatsuneeAuth.js
   ```

6. Copy and paste the JavaScript code into this file. Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

7. Initialize npm and install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm init -y
   npm install fs path crypto readline
   ```

8. Run the script:
   ```
   node hatsuneeAuth.js
   ```

## Replit Instructions

1. Go to [Replit](https://replit.com/) and sign in or create an account.

2. Click on "Create" to start a new project.

3. Choose "Node.js" as the template.

4. Name your project (e.g., "HatsuneeBot") and click "Create Repl".

5. In the main `index.js` file, paste the JavaScript code.

6. In the Shell tab, install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install fs path crypto readline
   ```

7. Click the "Run" button at the top of the screen to start your bot.

Note: Replit provides a virtual file system, so the bot will create and access the `session` folder and `enc.json` file within this virtual environment.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues in Termux, run `termux-setup-storage` and grant the necessary permissions.
- On Replit, make sure your code is set to run from `index.js` in the project settings.
- If you face any "module not found" errors, double-check that you've installed all required dependencies.
